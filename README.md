Description of the project - Task Management Web App

Ideas for future improvement:
-Getting the example list to work and to run only one time when the page loads and when there are no items in the list
-To be able to enter a task with pressing on the "enter" button on the keyboard
-Bringing the text selector back to the middle of the input form every time after adding a task
